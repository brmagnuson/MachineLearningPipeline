# MachineLearningPipeline
My masters thesis work: predicting the Sacramento River's natural flow using a variety of machine learning techniques.

This code makes use of my mlutilities package (which you can check out in its repo [here](https://github.com/brmagnuson/MachineLearningUtilities)) as well as sklearn and pandas, among others.

For a quick overview of my results, take a look at these [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3GXw7X31-VNNkFiLWFpaXpXa1k/view?usp=sharing).

If you want to know all the gritty details, [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3GXw7X31-VNNlFsSDMwbFVmY1k) is a copy of my thesis.
